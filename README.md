# 👋 Hey There  
### **“You scanned me… guess we’re already connected 😏”**

## 🌐 Welcome to My Corner of GitHub

Since you were bold enough to scan that code,  
you deserve something a little more interesting than just code.

### Here’s what you’ll find:
- 💻 Cool projects & experiments  
- 🤝 Collabs I’m open to  
- 😌 And maybe… someone you scanned for a reason

## 🔥 About Me
```bash
echo "Curious. Creative. Always building."
✨ Outro

If you’ve made it this far…
we might need to talk again.
My DMs are open.
